[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/benoitpas/java3-tree.svg?branch=main)](https://travis-ci.com/benoitpas/java3-tree)

Implemented with only features available in Java 1.2. I checked that it compiled and ran in 1.2 using jdk8.

Note: Java 1.2 was released in December 1998, Java 1.3 was released in May 2000 (c.f. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_version_history) and maven in 2001 https://maven.apache.org/background/history-of-maven.html
